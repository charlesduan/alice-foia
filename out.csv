Based on negotiations concerning price, timing and other typical concerns, an item is selected from the table and a price quotation associated with the selected inventory item is generated using the price forecasting system, which price quotation has been predetermined by a yield management system using a pricing strategy. The customer information associated with the customer request is input into a traffic billing system. Information needed for price recalculation associated with the customer request is input into the yield management system. The yield management system recalculates pricing data with in a manner consistent with a pricing strategy implemented by the yield management system, so that price changes caused by a reduction in available inventory due to the customer request are taken into account, and the pricing data accessed by the price forecasting system when a price quotation is generated is updated prior to repeating the process for a subsequent customer request. This method provides more accurate pricing than known systems where order information must be entered manually before a price recalculation can take place, and the yield management system overestimates the amount of available inventory. If the customer request comprises a reservation having an associated probability of later becoming an order, the reservation is taken into account when recalculating prices based on available inventory. Such a process may be integrated for an enterprise made up of a number of member stations each having associated inventory for sale.

                A system method of advertising using a multi-media application system is disclosed. The multi-media application relates to the delivery of multi-media messages using animated entities that audibly deliver messages created by a sender using text-to-speech technologies. The method provides targeted advertising based on information learned about both the sender of a multi-media message and the recipient of the multi-media message. The information may relate to an analysis of a text message created by the sender, emoticons chosen by the sender and inserted into the text of the message, the choice by the sender of an animated entity, or other parameters such as background music chosen for which template is chosen by the sender. Advertising messages may be delivered before the recipient receives the multi-media message, during the reception by the recipient of the multi-media message or following the reception of the multi-media message. A decision regarding whether to include an advertising message may be based on a text analysis or an analysis of the emoticons or other tags inserted into the text by the sender. Further, animated entities such as professionally designed face models, templates, additional emoticons, animation or sound effects may also be purchased by the sender for a limited number of multi-media messages, for limited amount of time or longer for use in creating multi-media messages. The system comprises a server to handle the reception and processing of sender multi-media messages and client software for both creating multi-media messages and receiving multi-media messages.

                Disclosed is a system and method that uses digital signature technology to authenticate the contents of one or more manifests located on a storage device. Each manifest contains a list of file records, where each record contains the name of a file stored on the storage device, and a signature value derived from the contents of the file. At boot time, the gaming machine first authenticates the contents of the manifest and then authenticates the contents of the files using the signature value stored in the manifest. Files are verified using the signature, as they are needed, during the boot up of the operating system and throughout normal operation. This method reduces the boot time of the gaming machine and eliminates the need to check digital signatures for each individual file or over the entire contents of a non-secure media. Similarly, a method of adding authentication ability to legacy software components without necessarily altering the legacy software components is disclosed. Introduction of a stronger authentication algorithm, or when a private key has been compromised would normally require the software component to be re-built to support the new algorithm or private/public key pair
                 however, a method is disclosed where algorithms and key pairs may be changed and applied to legacy software without having to re-built, re-test, re-sign, or re-submit the component to regulatory agencies for approval. Also disclosed is a system and method of establishing a trusted environment containing a gaming operating system and associated authentication module, file system drivers, and/or network drivers that may be used to in the process of authenticating contents of one or more manifests located on a storage device.

                A business process modeling framework is used for data quality analysis. The modeling framework represents the sources of transactions entering the information processing system, the various tasks within the process that manipulate or transform these transactions, and the data repositories in which the transactions are stored or aggregated. A subset of these tasks is associated as the potential error introduction sources, and the rate and magnitude of various error classes at each such task are probabilistically modeled. This model can be used to predict how changes in transactions volumes and business processes impact data quality at the aggregate level in the data repositories. The model can also account for the presence of error correcting controls and assess how the placement and effectiveness of these controls alter the propagation and aggregation of errors. Optimization techniques are used for the placement of error correcting controls that meet target quality requirements while minimizing the cost of operating these controls. This analysis also contributes to the development of business ""dashboards"" that allow decision-makers to monitor and react to key performance indicators (KPIs) based on aggregation of the transactions being processed. Data quality estimation in real time provides the accuracy of these KPIs (in terms of the probability that a KPI is above or below a given value), which may condition the action undertaken by the decision-maker.

                A real estate transaction and release tracking system ensures deeds of trust, liens and other encumbrances are released in a timely manner after a specified (or statutory) period of time following settlement of a real estate transaction. Based on information provided by an agent, such as an escrow agent or a settlement agent, the system creates a unique electronic record for each real estate transaction entered by the agent. The system tracks lien status information, either automatically from other computers or via manual input from searchers, and uses this status information to track each real estate transaction. The system monitors the records and indicates when a lien holder has failed to release their lien after a statutory time period that begins after the passing of the settlement date. When the statutory time period has passed, the system can generate a number of forms, including a demand letter as controlled optionally by the system or the user. The demand letter can be sent to the lien holder demanding them to release the lien. If the lien is not thereafter released, further legal documents can be generated and sent to a law firm or enforcement agent for legal action to be taken against the delinquent lien holder.

The user utility function allows advertisement space to be allocated based upon, among other things, the expected utility or usefulness that a proposed advertisement will have to a user. The user utility function, for example, compares proposed advertisements to historical user actions to generate respective user utility values for advertisements (e.g., based upon user responses to advertisements for particular types of product, responses to advertisements from particular types of sellers, etc.). The user utility values can then be applied to bids submitted by advertisers for advertisement space for particular advertisements to obtain modified bids. The modified bids thus reflect, among other things, the expected utility of an advertisement to a user, and thus allow an advertisement host to allocate advertisement space accordingly.

                The current invention is based, at least in part, on the recognition that there is a problem of missed commercial opportunities when a commercial vendor is a mobile provider of goods or services. A need exists for facilitating communication between a mobile provider of goods or services and a potential recipient of those goods or services. Ideally, a solution to this need would not require a human dispatcher as an intermediary, due to various inefficiencies associated with such a method. In accordance with an aspect of the current invention, the limitation of missed business opportunities is avoided by (1) activating, by a mobile provider of commercial goods or services, a notification regarding availability to provide said commercial goods or services within a given distance of said mobile provider
                 and, (2) receiving, in response to said notification, and at a mobile location of said mobile provider of commercial goods or services, a request from a requester who is within the given distance of said mobile provider to provide said commercial goods or services to said requester. This method maximizes commercial opportunities between two parties without the need for a human dispatcher as an intermediary.

                a primary account number (""PAN"") of a conventional credit or debit account with a bank or other financial institution is emulated or simulated, which incorporates, in encrypted form, the actual account number. The simulated PAN may also incorporate an amount to be debited from that account. Thus, an account number and an amount are encrypted and mapped into a string of digits which appears to be a valid PAN. The actual account number and the transaction amount are thus embedded in the simulated PAN. The simulated PAN is then processed by existing financial transacting infrastructure, with the issuing bank knowing that it is not a PAN and that the appropriate digits are to be decrypted to provide the embedded account number and the embedded amount. In one application, a transactor wishing to effect a financial transaction, generates a simulated PAN and supplies it to a supplier of goods or services from whom he wishes to purchase said goods or services. The supplier enters the simulated PAN and the amount of the transaction in a conventional way. This data is then transmitted to an acquiring bank, which onwardly transmits it to the issuing bank for authorisation. The issuing bank then extracts the embedded account number and embedded amount, checks that the embedded amount and the supplied amount are the same (as well as other conventional checks), and if they are the same authorizes the transaction. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, in most instances, a transactor is required to provide an expiry date and a card verification value (""CVV""). Either or both of these could also be simulated and used to encrypt information

Then, a target vehicle speed is computed by adding the target vehicle speed of the last cycle to the product of the correction factor, target acceleration and the cycle time of the control, and the braking or driving force of each wheel is controlled so that the vehicle speed becomes equal to the target vehicle speed. In this manner, a passenger of the vehicle is prevented from feeling uncomfortable about the speed increase after the completion of the vehicle speed limit control.

Weights may depend on, for example, bids or costs. Messages may be passed, for example over a network between processors respective to the nodes. Belief values reflecting a best matching can be continuously updated for each node responsively to the value information and received messages to rank the matches respective to each node, which progressively improve. This allows short or complete terminations conditions to determine the goodness of the matching. Differing numbers of matches respective to each member of the disjoint sets and distributions of the desirability of different numbers of matches can be integrated in the matchings in respective embodiments.

                A gift registry providing a partial payment option for gift givers and a mandatory and contingent gift substitution for gift recipients. The gift recipient registers any type of gift idea from any store or establishment, for any occasion with an associated gift amount in the registry. The registrant is able to name their own gift price by selecting a gift amount not necessarily the same as the retail cost of the gift idea. The gift recipient also indicates whether they will accept a contingent substitute of gift or cash if the system is unable to provide the gift idea at the gift amount. The recipient can also select mandatory substitution of gift or cash. The difference between mandatory and contingent substitution is that mandatory substitution automatically occurs while contingent substitution occurs if and only if the selected gift is unavailable at the specified gift amount or could not be delivered in time. In effect, mandatory substitution for cash allows the registrant to arrange for automatic gift return and receipt of a cash gift. Gift givers are able to review gift ideas and associated gift amounts and select them. A gift giver is also able to select a gift idea and make a partial contribution toward purchase of the gift idea. This allows higher cost gifts to be purchased by multiple gift givers and thereby provides recipients and givers with greater flexibility in their gift selection. When a mandatory or contingent substitution for cash is provided, the system includes incentives, such as coupons. The coupons or incentives are independently profitable and help to offset the cost of managing the mandatory and contingent substitutions.

                Articles such as compact discs are traded among a plurality of members who are registered in a common community. Each member has an account including a trading credit balance and a mailing address. A user interface is provided that allows a member to enter articles that the member owns and is willing to trade and articles that the member wants to own. The user interface also receives article trading instruction messages. An administration computer hosts the plurality of members and facilitates article trades among the members. The administration computer identifies matches between owned and wanted articles. For each identified match, an article trading instruction message is sent to the article owner requesting that the article owner mail the owned article to the mailing address of the member who wants to own the article. If the member sends the article, a trading credit is posted to the member's account and a trading debit and a monetary charge is posted to the member's account who will be receiving the article. Each traded article has the same trading credit. A priority algorithm is used to select the member who will receive the article if there is more than one member who wants an article that another member owns and is willing to trade. The priority algorithm is based in part on a member score that is a function of the relative value of the articles that a member owns and sends to another member compared to the relative value of the articles that the member wants and receives from another member, the relative value of the articles being determined by a demand for the article compared to a supply for the article among the members. A portion of the monetary charge is placed in a pool for distribution to the content creator of the article.

                Various embodiments provide techniques for advertisement inventory. In at least some embodiments, a scaled number of impressions can be matched to orders that have scaled impression goals. Impressions can be randomly selected from an offline traffic model and allocated to orders according to a matching algorithm until a number of impression defined by a scale factor is reached. This can occur by sampling the traffic model directly using the scale factor and/or by creating a scaled data set to which the matching algorithm can be applied. The matching algorithm can be configured to identify an order that is farthest away from being complete and then match the randomly selected impression to the identified order. If the scaled orders in the data set can be fulfilled using the scaled number of impressions, a conclusion is made that the original set of orders can be fulfilled using the original impressions.

It will be appreciated that the submission and verification techniques can, among other things, automate the submission and verification of redemption codes for various redeemable instruments, including transaction cards (e.g., gift or prepaid cards) widely used for online transactions (e.g., purchase of media items from an online media store). A redemption code can be determined based on an image of a redeemable instrument. More particularly, an image of a redeemable instrument can be processed using image analysis or one or more image processing techniques to extract a redemption code for the redeemable instrument. By way of example, an image (e.g., a digital picture) of a gift card can be processed by a device to extract an alphanumeric value printed on the gift card. This means that the alphanumeric value need not be entered manually by a person seeking to redeem the redeemable instrument (e.g., gift card). As a result, users can simply take a picture of a redeemable instrument (e.g., gift card) rather than having to manually enter long alphanumeric values commonly used today.

                A computer implemented method, system, and/or computer program product predicts the profitability of a current project. Historical data from the current project represents profit data points at predetermined intervals of time during the current project. If a linear regression model of the historical data does not adequately describe the historical data, then a polynomial regression model to describe the historical data is generated. If the polynomial model does not adequately describe the historical data, then another project that is similar to the current project is located. This other project has its own set of historical data. If the historical data from the other project fits the polynomial regression model created from the historical data of the current project, then the polynomial regression model is trusted to accurately predict the profitability of the current project, even though the current project's historical data did not adequately fit the polynomial regression model.

                A system makes payments from each payer of a community of payers to each vendor of a community of vendors, assesses a variable transaction fee to each vendor, and provides a variable rebate to each payer. The transaction fee is variable because it may be varied: i) amongst vendors (the same payer may use different fee rates for different vendors)
                 and ii) amongst payers (the same vendor may be subjected to different rates, based on the payer making the payment). The variable rebate is based on the total transaction fee applicable to payments made by the payer during a period of time. The rebate may be the sum of: i) the product of the total transaction fee multiplied by a base rebate percentage
                 and ii) the product of that portion of the total transaction fee in excess of an accelerator threshold multiplied by an accelerated rebate percentage.

                A linked account instrument is used to access funds in an existing demand deposit account held at a financial institution. Merchant or other transactions are first processed against a demand deposit account via an electronic authorization network. If the demand deposit account does not have sufficient funds, the transactions may be processed as a credit charge against an designated credit account. The demand deposit account may subsequently be swept at predetermined times in search of funds to defray the overdraft. If adequate funds are present, they will be withdrawn from the demand deposit account, and the credit account will be cleared. Otherwise, the instrument holder's daily purchasing abilities may be temporarily suspended until the credit account is settled. The processing of overdraft amounts may be on a FIFO, smallest-first or other basis.

For subsequent periods, the price is the backup capacity times the price rate times the actual amount of data recovered in the prior time period. The method also includes a data backup and recovery method using the data recovery pricing method, which provides tracker software to measure the amount of data recovered.
